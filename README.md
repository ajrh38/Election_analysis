5.- Finally again we conclude that Diana Degette wont the election. <br /> 

## Election-audit Summary and Proposal <br /> 
This script(python Code) can be applied to elections accross other counties with minimum modifications like
1.- modifying the source document file and naming
2.-Changing some of the variables to calculate the winner by county and not only by district by adding the calculation to meet a conditional by county.
